<p>I’ve used Little Bird, a tool that measures social influence, to determine the most influential tweeters and bloggers on the topics of “mobile strategy” and “mobile architecture.” Despite how awesome this tool is (seriously though, I really love it), it was difficult to track down influential people with these job titles.I even tried searching on LinkedIn for top mobile architects.Out of twenty, fourteen don’t have a Twitter account.And, only one tweets several times per week.</p>
