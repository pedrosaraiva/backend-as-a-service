<p>Urban Airship, one of our fellow Mobile Backend as a Service providers has decided to sunset their IAP (in app purchase) and subscription based services as of the 1st of July.This means that if you track your IAPs or subscriptions through Urban Airship, you’ve got less than a month until you have to either migrate out or cancel these services in your app.The reason, according to UA, for this is due to their messaging products taking off in such a big way that they have been unable to support these services and have now decided that it is better to sunset them rather than have an effectively unsupported product sitting there.This is sadly often the case for companies providing services, one section takes off and the rest gets left behind.An interesting question is whether this trend is likely to continue throughout the mBaaS industry.</p>
