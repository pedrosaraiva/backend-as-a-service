{% include JB/setup %}<p>In our last lesson I created a page from HTML to show as the Welcome page.I have been asked by many people what code I used and how I got the page to look that way.Although there is an easy to use HTML editor, many people prefer to create their own page using code themselves.Today I will take you through a simple step by step guide to the code to create an HTML page like the welcome page I created on my app.To follow this tutorial please copy and paste this code into the HTML page in your dashboard.If you wish to try the code first, you can use the code editor provided for free from W3schools.com.Don’t forget to delete anything that is written in grey and is in (brackets).What is in red is what you may change.HTML – The header bar
 
 Our page is split into three sections, header, body and footer.</p>
