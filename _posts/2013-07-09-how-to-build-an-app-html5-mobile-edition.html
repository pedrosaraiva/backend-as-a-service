<p>Today, we’ve released a free eBook titled “How to Build an App: HTML5 Mobile Edition.” We aim to provide content that helps make your app development process easier, faster, and better overall.Seeing as the number of HTML5-compatible phones on which your application could potentially run is very large — expected to top 1 billion in 2013 — this guide helps you take advantage of the language’s increasing popularity and relevance.Our guide takes a look at what an HTML5 app consists of, what are some of the more popular tools available to help you through the process — and explore why (or why not) you might choose to go the HTML5 route.To get straight to the meat, click here to download the free book.</p>
