<p>With those simple words, great soul and jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron reminded us that things are changing and changing fast.As he once explained, “That song was about your mind.You have to change your mind before you change the way you live and the way you move…The thing that’s going to change people will be something that no one will ever be able to capture on film.It will just be something you see and all of a sudden you realize ‘I’m on the wrong page.’”
 Those who are successful in business today never find themselves on the wrong page.</p>
