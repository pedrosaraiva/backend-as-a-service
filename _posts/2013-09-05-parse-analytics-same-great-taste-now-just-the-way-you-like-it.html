<p>Over the last few months, we’ve been busy working on ways to let you see a little more closely into the workings of your app and the overall Parse experience.First, we released Push Analytics to provide insight into user interactions around push notifications.A little later, we expanded our realtime offerings to take a closer look at all API Requests passing through Parse.We’re proud to announce the next logical progression in this series of analytics-centric features: Custom Analytics.In addition to being able to slice and dice the details of your use of Parse Data and Parse Push, you can now track arbitrary events with an arbitrary set of dimensions.</p>
