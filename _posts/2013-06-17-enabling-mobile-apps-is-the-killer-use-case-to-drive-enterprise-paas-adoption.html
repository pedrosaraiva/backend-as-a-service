<p>It has been officially announced that Savvis, a data center operator, acquired Platform as a Service (PaaS) company AppFog.This move lands Savvis its very own Cloud Foundry-based PaaS to run on top of its existing infrastructure.What this means for AppFog customers is more infrastructure options (including Savvis’ public cloud service), increased levels of support and accelerated launches of new features, according to their website.PaaS, as Barb Darrow points out in an article from last week, has not gained much traction in the enterprise.CIOs have yet to buy the concept – there hasn’t been a killer use case for PaaS in the enterprise to convince them to do so.</p>
