<p>Zapier lets you make hundreds of different connections between different cloud services.Right now there are over 160 different services Zapier can talk to.Some of the popular ones being used with Xero are Wufoo, Google Docs, Paypal, Dropbox, Evernote, Zoho and Zendesk.It is easy to create your own connections without any knowledge of the code or APIs behind it.There are two main ways you might use Zapier and Xero: If you are using a bunch of different cloud applications to run your business and want them to talk to each other but there is not always a direct connection – or maybe you want to customise exactly how that connection works – that is where Zapier comes in.</p>
