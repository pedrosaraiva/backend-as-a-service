<p>The Dashboard is an essential piece of the Parse experience.We care deeply about it, and know how much you love having this web user interface to see the analytics of your apps, to follow up on your Cloud Code deploys, to visualize and edit your data in the Data Browser, and to schedule advanced Push notifications.Today, we’re very excited to introduce a redesign of the Dashboard that we hope you will love just as much as we do.With the new design, we’ve made sure that the UI gets out of the way, so you can focus more on what you’re doing, as well as your data.We’re also very excited that the Dashboard is now stretchable, which means you can expand your Data Browser or the documentation without going into full screen mode.</p>
